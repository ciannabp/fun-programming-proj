I really like the color scheme you chose to use and the plot is very beautifully done and made! I also really liked how you did one custom function that lead into your map/parallel iteration, it felt very naturally done!

Three areas of strength:

One thing I learned:

Areas for improvement:
1. I really liked your used of cowplot to put your multiple plots on screentime by race and school year side by side. However, once put together, the font was really small. I'd suggest increasing the font size for the title, subtitle, and labels (I changed it in the code above). It also might help space-wise to only put the caption once so it doesn't have to repeat on every plot, I added some code that does that.
